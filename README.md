# UUID-Generate
 This is a UUID (A.K.A. GUID) generator that generates standard UUIDs (i.e. `66BD58C5-E715-0941-1A11-5FE9289C141C`) and stores the new UUID in the UUID environmental variable (i.e. `%UUID%` or `!UUID!`), outputs the UUID as standard output, and also copies the new UUID to your clipboard if you are running Windows Vista or later.
